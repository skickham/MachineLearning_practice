#Variables in the dataset:
#-Admit: A binary variable indicating whether or not a student was admitted to
#        the graduate school.
#-GRE: A continuous variable indicating a student's score on the GRE.
#-GPA: A contunuous variable indicating a student's undergraduate grade point
#      average.
#-Rank: A categorical variable indicating the level of prestige of a school; 1
#       indicates the highest prestige, 4 indicates the lowest prestige.

#Coefficient interpretations on the log odds scale:
#-Intercept: The log odds of a student getting admitted to a graduate school
#            when they attended a top tier undergraduate school and received a
#            0 on the GRE and a 0 as their GPA is approximately -3.990.
#-GRE: For every additional point a student scores on the GRE, their log odds
#      of being admitted to graduate school increase by approximately 0.002,
#      holding all other variables constant.
#-GPA: For every additional point a student raises their GPA, their log odds of
#      being admitted to graduate school increase by approximately 0.804, holding
#      all other variables constant.
#-Rank: The change in log odds associated with attending an undergraduate school
#       with prestige of rank 2, 3, and 4, as compared to a school with prestige
#       rank 1, is approximately -0.675, -1.340, and -1.552, respectively, holding
#       all other variables constant.

reduced.df = logit.norank$df.residual    #model (the one without rank) to...

full.deviance = logit.overall$deviance #...the deviance of the full model (the
full.df = logit.overall$df.residual    #one with the rank terms).

pchisq(reduced.deviance - full.deviance,

#The p-value is extremely small (<.0005); we have evidence to conclude that the
#model with the factors for rank is preferable to the model without the factors
#for rank.

#More simply, we can use the anova() function and set the test to "Chisq".

#It seems like this model made a lot of mistakes (116 out of 400)! This is quite
#dreadful in this case. Let's do a little bit more exploring. We never looked at
#the overall test of deviance:
pchisq(logit.overall$deviance, logit.overall$df.residual, lower.tail = FALSE)    
# overall dev test, prob less than 5%, so model is proper (?) not very different from before

#The p-value for the overall test of deviance is <.05, indicating that this model
#is not a good overall fit!

#What about checking the McFadden's pseudo R^2 based on the deviance?
1 - logit.overall$deviance/logit.overall$null.deviance

#Only about 8.29% of the variability in admission appears to be explained by
#the predictors in our model; while the model is valid, it seems as though it
#isn't extremely informative.

#What have we found out? The overall model we created doesn't give us much
#predictive power in determining whether a student will be admitted to
#graduate school.
table(GradSchools$admit) #Our data contains 273 unadmitted students and 127
                         #admitted students.
table(admitted.predicted) #The model we created predicts that 351 students will
                          #not be admitted, and only 49 will be admitted.
table(truth = GradSchools$admit, prediction = admitted.predicted)

#The table of the truth against the prediction shows that we only have an accuracy
#of (254 + 30)/400 = 71%; yet, if we were to simply predict "unadmitted" for
#everyone uniformly, we would have an accuracy of 273/400 = 68.25%! No wonder
#why the overall test of deviance was insignificant -- predicting only the
#intercept of the baseline probability was just as sufficient!
